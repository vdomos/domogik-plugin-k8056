K8056 relay board management

Coomand on,off relay of K8056 board With xPL Messages

    Technical Description of K8056 Board serial protocol

    Port RS232 is configure with this setting: 2400/8/n/1
    To control the k8056 card, the correct sequence needs to be send like this:
    Ascii code 13
    Card address (1..255)
    Instruction (see below), only supported now 'S'|'C'|'T' set/clear/toggle
    Relay #('1'..'9'), 9 for all relay.
    Checkum, it is the 2-complement of the sum of the 4 previous bytes + 1.
        In Python, checksum = ( 255 - (13 + int('1') + ord('S') + ord('1')) % 256 ) + 1

    Instructions:
    'E': Emergency stop all cards.
    'D': Display address of all cards in a binary fashion (LD1:MSB, LD8:LSB)
    'S': Set a relay, followed by relay # ('1'..'9' in ASCII), 9 for all relay.
    'C': Clear a relay, followed by relay # ('1'..'9' in ASCII), 9 for all relay.
    'T': Toggle a relay, followed by relay # ('1'..'8' in ASCII).
    'A': Change the current address of a card, followed by the address (1..255)
    'F': Force all cards address to 1 (default)
    'B': Send a byte, Allows to control the 8 relays in 1 byte (LD1:MSB, LD8:LSB)
